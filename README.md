SupplyHouse.com Programming Test
========

This is my SupplyHouse.com Programming Test github page. Within the 3 folders we have:

* [```Problem1```](https://github.com/southpenguin/SHouse/tree/master/Problem1)
* [```Problem2```](https://github.com/southpenguin/SHouse/tree/master/Problem2)
* [```Problem3```](https://github.com/southpenguin/SHouse/tree/master/Problem3)

In each folder, I have ```README.md``` file explain my thoughts and details of the problem. 
Just scroll down to the bottom you can see the contents of ```README.md``` file.

Thank you for browsing my github page.
